### defination of Darkweb

**The dark web is a part of the internet that isn't indexed by search engines. You've no doubt heard talk of the “dark 
web” as a hotbed of criminal activity — and it is. Researchers Daniel Moore and Thomas Rid of King's College in London 
classified the contents of 2,723 live dark web sites over a five-week period in 2015 and found that 57% host illicit 
material.**

### Dark web sites
** Dark web sites look pretty much like any other site, but there are important differences. One is the naming 
stracture . Instead of ending in `.com` or `.co` , dark web sites end in `.onion` .
